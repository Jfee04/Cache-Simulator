cache structure
    contains x sets of n blocks
        Block Index = floor(Memory_Address / Block_Size) mod Block_Count
        each block has a 
            tag   bits floor(Memory_Address / Cache_Size) 
            valid bit
    m words per block
        Block Offset (which byte inside block) = Memory_Address mod Block_Size
    total of n * m words



on read 
    find the cache block associated with that adress
    check if valid
    check if the tag is apropriate
    if yes record hit
    if no record miss and update block to be correct size
